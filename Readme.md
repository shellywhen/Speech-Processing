# Speech Processing

 A simple python toolkit that supports multiple analysis tasks on an audio file of speech. This is in service of "Speaker+", a web-based intelligent training environment that auguments close-loop skill acquisition.

```python
import SpeechProcessing as SP
config = {'username':'USERNAME','password':'PASSWORD'}
speech_transcript = SP.Audio(config,'RELATIVE_PATH.wav'ï¼‰
# return an Audio object list with sentences and corresponding timestamps
phonetic_info = speech_transcript.segment().output()
# get further phonetic information of each sentences and output a json file as shown in 'test_transcript.json'
```

- **Speech Recognition**: transcripts in a stence-level under IBM Watson Cloud Service. 
- **Speech Analysis**: speaking rate(syl/s), fillers (fillers/minute), pitch variety(Hz)
